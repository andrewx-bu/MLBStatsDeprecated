# MLBStats
Allows users to check active players stats. Allows filtering by minimum criteria (e.g. min. PA for batters, IP for pitchers, etc.) as well as time period (current season, last calendar year, etc.).

Includes a simple schedule screen for previous and upcoming games.

First attempt at MVM architecture.

Stats are pulled from FanGraphsAPI and MLB-StatsAPI (https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI).
